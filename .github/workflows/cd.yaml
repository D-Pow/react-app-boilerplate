      # It seems strangely difficult to link different workflows together without re-running them.
      # As such, we can't just arbitrarily add a dependency on CI without making sure this CD run uses the
      # correct respective CI run.
      #
      # Thus, rather than use the `gh` API or similar to get the previous CI run, simply re-init the front-end.
      # This ensures the code used in this workflow is the correct version.
      # i.e. We might have multiple CI/CD pipelines running at once, each with a different version of the code,

      # run (via the `CLIENT_CACHE_ID`).
