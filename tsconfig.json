     * This file is only used for development.
     * It ensures all non-src directories use the same rules as the
     * main tsconfig file by parsing all directories, not just src/,
     * such that all TS/JS files still understand aliases, JSDoc, etc.
     * from each other.
     *
     * For example, without this, a TS file in config/ that imports a JS
     * file wouldn't necessarily pick up the JSDoc from JS, so the TS file
     * wouldn't know how to call the function.
     *
     * That being said, this is generally only a problem for IDEs, not
     * linters or other tools, because IDEs (usually) automatically parse
     * only the closest tsconfig.json file, not any others with different
     * names (e.g. tsconfig.tests.json).
     * Thus, to avoid putting a tsconfig.json file with the same contents
     * as this one in every single directory, just use this one root-level
     * file for IDEs but then don't use it in any code/read only the one
     * it extends in config files (e.g. webpack.config).
